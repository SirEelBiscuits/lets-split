# lets-split

a custom remake of the lets split keyboard pcb

PCB designed to match [this case](git remote add origin https://github.com/SirEelBiscuits/lets-split.git).

Uses the QMK firmware, my fork of which is here: https://github.com/SirEelBiscuits/qmk_firmware/tree/garnet

As yet, keyboard and keymap are not merged upstream.
